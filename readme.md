## Description

With the demise of Delicious (well, basically) I wanted to move to a self-hosted solution I could control and change how I saw fit. [Stephanie Leary](http://stephanieleary.com/) had developed Twenty Links which I thought was pretty close, however there were some things I wanted to change and add. The Tasty child theme is the result of that.

Full link management, custom bookmarklet, duplicate link checking, tag auto complete are just some of the featured included.

It's important to note this theme is meant to stand alone. It should **not** be dropped into an existing site but rather should be setup with a WordPress install that will be dedicated to housing your bookmarks. Because of this I chose to wrap everything in the theme and there are no plugins needed for this.

With some work, the functionality could be pulled and developed into a plugin which could then be used on a normal WordPress install, however since I have 2,000+ bookmarks I wanted to keep everything seperate in its own install.

I have been using this personally for over a year without any issues. Occasionally I need to tweak CSS for WordPress updates, but that has been it. I finally decided to clean it up and release it as I figured others could benefit from it as well.


**This theme requires the [Genesis Framework](http://www.jaredatchison.com/go/genesis)**. I developed it on Genesis simply because that was what was most efficent for me. If you do not own the Genesis Framework I encourage you to check out [Twenty Links](http://stephanieleary.com/2010/12/twenty-links-a-delicious-inspired-twenty-ten-child-theme/), though it does not contain some features such as the custom bookmarklet or dupe checking.
